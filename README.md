# [Simple Sidebar Port BS4]

## Originally:
[Simple Sidebar](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/) is an off canvas sidebar navigation template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Bugs and Issues
Have a bug or an issue with this template? [Open a new issue](git@github.com:ryanhell/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar.git/issues) here on GitHub or leave a comment on the [template overview page at Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/). I cant guernantee I will get back to anyone immediately but I do live for helping others and I am always interested in learning and code collaberations. Lets build!

## Creator/s
This was a slightly modernfied' fork of David Miller's tried-and-trued 'Simple Sidebar' [https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/] based on BS3x. The Alpha BS4 Candidates have been progressing decently so I wanted to get started with something as a foundation for the newer rule sets and style sheets.

## WHY?
Its likely my projects will be needing some BS4 features soon. I figured "why not make these simple changes in order to get onboard a little bit now?".

##Who Is Start Bootstrap?
